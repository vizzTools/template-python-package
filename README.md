# template-python-package

Template to be used to create python packages

## Todo

- add sphinx doc generation.

## Notes

Pylint can be quite anoying now since it doesn't have any disabled modules and it complains about everything.
 We remove rules by adding them to `[tool.pylint.messages_control]` `disable` definition.
